This is the initial stab at an app I've had in my head for a while. Helps people help others in their own community. Sort of open-sourcing benevolence and charity. Not taking it away from great organizations, but making it easier for folks to personally do simple acts of kindness to improve their neighborhoods and grow their own hearts.
